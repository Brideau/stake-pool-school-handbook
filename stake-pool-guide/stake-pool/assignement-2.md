  As explained before, core and relay nodes must run in separate machines. In
  this assignment you will create a second server or Virtual Machine to host
  your core node.

# Assignement-2

{% hint style="success" %}
Try to complete the following tasks in a second server:

1. Create a second server on AWS or Virtual Machine in Virtual Box. This one will host your core node and hold your stake pool keys.
2. Install dependencies
3. Install cabal 
4. Install GHC 
5. Install libsodium 
6. Create the directory .local/bin and add it to the PATH 
7. Build the node from source in your new server or Virtual Machine. 
8. Get Configuration files

Repeat what you learned on [lesson 1](../getting-started/install-node.md)
